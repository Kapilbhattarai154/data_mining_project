# Movie Recommendation System

## Introduction

This proposal outlines developing a movie recommendation system that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), providing personalized recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences. The system will use collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to make recommendations and will be developed using Python, NLP, and big data technologies. The proposed methodology involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, and deployment. We aim to build a system that is accurate, fast, and easy for users. The movie recommendation system will help users discover new movies that match their interests and provide an enhanced user experience.
